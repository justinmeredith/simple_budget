Simple Budget

Takes in hourly pay and average weekly hours and generates a simple budget based on this information.
Works for groups of varied size to accommodate for joint households, i.e. couples, roommates, etc., as well as a single individual.

Make sure your computer has Ruby installed before running. You can do this using "ruby -v" in your terminal.
It is recommended to have the program saved somewhere memorable and uncluttered, like a desktop or folder specifically for the program.

You can run two ways:

1) Double click the program and run it using the Ruby Interpreter.

or

2) In the terminal, switch to the directory containing the program. Once there, type "ruby simple_budget.rb" and hit enter.


Enter in your information exactly. If you earn salary, you can do the math to figure out how much you make per hour. If you earn commission, you can choose to leave out or estimate this amount.
When asked if you would like to set a savings goal, entering 'yes' will open up a new set of questions and options. This feature is meant to help you set your goal and determine how long it will take to reach this goal. Entering 'no' will finish the program per usual.
When the program finishes, it will generate a .txt file containing your budget and income information. The .txt file will be saved to whatever folder the program is in. It will also display the path to this folder for easier finding, just in case you are not sure where the program is located or there is a problem finding the .txt file.
