# This program calculates what someone/s make per month, per year,
# and what they can afford to pay monthly for a living space

# All function names end with "_func" to distinguish them from variables.
# "member" refers to a single individual involved in the budget. Each member
# is stored as a nested array inside of the array "members"
# "members" refers to the group of individuals as a whole. They are stored
# in an array called "members".
# "user" in the context of code is a variable used to reference a nested member,
# i.e. "user = 1" would be referencing the second member of the budget.
# "user" in the context of comments and meta is referring to the person
# actually running the program.
# Comments that look like "# - - - - - - TEXT - - - - - - - #" are used to
# separate the different groupings of code blocks within the
# program. They are merely for the sake of easing the process
# of reading the code.

Combined, this household makes $#{sprintf('%.2f', combined_monthly)} per month, and $#{sprintf('%.2f', combined_annual)} per year.

Here is a break down of your monthly budget:
  * You can afford a living expense of $#{sprintf('%.2f', living)}.
  * You can afford $#{sprintf('%.2f', bills)} in bills.
  * You can afford $#{sprintf('%.2f', gas)} in gas.
  * You can afford $#{sprintf('%.2f', groceries)} in groceries and food.

This leaves you with roughly $#{sprintf('%.2f', leftover)} left over
for spending and saving.
Keep in mind that these estimates are based on averages,
and provide room for flexibility.
Also remember to try and stay under budget so that
you have more left over each month.
